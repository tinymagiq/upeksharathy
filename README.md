Helps sharathy(driver) to be in Upeksha(a state of being balanced)

## Setup 
- Ram is a good driver
- Pappu is an stupid / unaware driver . Paapu does too much of driving that he has become olivious to  bad driving. Like a smoker does not find the smoke smelling  bad. Paappu has go used to his bad drving like cutting lanes without indicator or jumping red lights or not slowing down at turning. 
- They come across each other on the road  every day. And every time they have skirmish barely stop short of fist fight. This is a case of road rage. 
- Both feel they would love to reduce their expenditure.

## Conflict
- Ram gets stressed out everyday because of Pappu.   The result both are stressed out. 
- This has  ripple effect for both Ram and Pappu as they carry their frustrations even when they get off the vehicle either into their houses in the evening or into the office in the morning. 
- They are not even aware why are they are angry with their loved ones.  

## Resolution 
- Pappu is made aware of his driving by supporting him with real time information on whenever he does a gross violation like cutting lanes without indicator to drifting or weaving across lanes. 
- Basically the device increases his awareness which he has lost due to years to bad conditioning. 
- Pappu gradually over a period of 3-4 months becomes more mindfull of his driving. Reducing the stress on himself and others around. 
- There are many Pappus and Rams who drive along with us everyday. 


**Upeksharathy** -  Upeksha is sanskrit word for ability to maintain balance and Sarathy is a driver.  The objective is to create mindfull drivers and creating stress free roads and driving.
